# react-examples
Used the react start kit and implemented customized examples from react website https://facebook.github.io/react/docs for learning purposes.

base_app has the simple hello world example.
Every folder has app.s, index.html and README. README explains what features that example covers.

To run a new example. Modify the existing code under src or run as it is to execute the hello buddy example,
```
yarn install
cp base_app/* src/ - optional
yarn run app
```

Copy the folder contents and run the app to execute the example. For example to run clock-updater
```
cp clock-updater/* src/
yarn run app
```
